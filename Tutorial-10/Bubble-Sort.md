## bubble sort Algorithm: 

### PASS 1:

>     compare the first 2 elements [10, 7] and find which node is greater.
    [10, 7, 3, 9, 15, 1, 4] -> [7, 10, 3, 8, 15, 1, 4] swaps [10, 7] because 10 > 7
    [7, 10, 3, 8, 15, 1, 4] -> [7, 3, 10, 8, 15, 1, 4] swaps [10, 3] because 10 > 3
    [7, 3, 10, 8, 15, 1, 4] -> [7, 3, 8, 10, 15, 1, 4] swaps [10 8] because 10 > 8
    [7, 3, 8, 10, 15, 1, 4] -> [7, 3, 8, 10, 15, 1, 4] no swap [10, 15] already sorted 15 > 10
    [7, 3, 8, 10, 15, 1, 4] -> [7, 3, 8, 10, 1, 15, 4] swaps [15, 1] because 15 > 1
    [7, 3, 8, 10, 1, 15, 4] -> [7, 3, 8, 10, 1, 4, 15] swaps [15, 4] because 15 > 4

### PASS 2:
    [7, 3, 8, 10, 1, 4, 15] -> [3, 7, 8, 10, 1, 4, 15]: swap 7 > 3
    [3, 7, 8, 10, 1, 4, 15] NO swap 8 > 7
    [3, 7, 8, 10, 1, 4, 15] NO swap 10 > 8
    [3, 7, 8, 10, 1, 4, 15] -> [3, 7, 8, 1, 10, 4, 15] swap 10 > 1
    [3, 7, 8, 1, 10, 4, 15] -> [3, 7, 8, 1, 4, 10, 15] swap 10 > 4
    [3, 7, 8, 1, 4, 10, 15] NO swap 15 > 10
### PASS 3:
    [3, 7, 8, 1, 4, 10, 15] NO swap 7 > 3
    [3, 7, 8, 1, 4, 10, 15] NO swap 8 > 7
    [3, 7, 8, 1, 4, 10, 15] swap 8 > 1 
    [3, 7, 1, 8, 4, 10, 15] swap 8 > 4
    [3, 7, 1, 4, 8, 10, 15] NO swap 10 > 8 & 15 >10
### PASS 4:
    [3, 7, 1, 4, 8, 10, 15] NO 7 > 3
    [3, 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] swap 7 > 1
    [3, 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] NO 7 > 4
    [3, 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] NO 8 > 7
    [3, 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] NO 10 > 8
    [3, 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] NO 15 > 10
### PASS 4:
    [3, 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] swap 3 > 1
    [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] NO 4 > 3, 
    [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] NO 7 > 4
    [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] NO 8 > 7
    [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] NO 10 > 8
    [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] NO 15 > 10
>     The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted
### PASS 5:
    [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] -> [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15]
    [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] -> [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15]
    [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] -> [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15]
    [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] -> [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15]
    [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] -> [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15]
    [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15] -> [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15]
